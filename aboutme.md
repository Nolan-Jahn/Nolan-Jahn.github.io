### My story

My name is Nolan Jahn and I am a PhD graduate student at Michigan State University, with my primary research interest being communication neuroscience. I work in the Neuroscience of Messages Lab (NOM Lab) under the leadership of my advisor Dr. Ralf Schm√§lzle. Additionally, I function as the lab manager in the Center for Avatar Research and Immersive Social Media Applications (CARISMA) Lab, under Dr. Gary Bente, leading research projects that untitlize an array of methodologies (e.g., electroencephalography, motion capture, eye-tracking, virtual reality) to advance work in nonverbal communication, user-experience, health communication, and communicatoin neuroscience. 

My extended time at MSU has affored the opportunity to traverse from natural sciences into social sciences, and exist in an interdiciplinary combination of the two via neuroscience and psychophysiological methods in a social science field. Retrospectively, this turned out to be the perfect fit, as I bounced around during my undergradute schooling between working in a advocacy nonprofit and a entmology lab. I look forward to what post-graduate life holds instore, I can say with certainity it will be interdisciplinary endeavor.
